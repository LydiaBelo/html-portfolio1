<p>Hi, I am Lidiia. I decided to become a Web Developer in 2023. My background is in financial analhysis and project management in 
  government settings. However, things have changed during my second maternity leave. After a lot of reflection, research and informal interviews,
  I realied I wanted to pursue a career in Web Development. I have found a course on Udemy and my journey has begun.</p>

<p>Slowly, but surely, I was learning how to code and was falling in love with it more and more.</p>

<p>On this web-site you will find examples of my work. Let's connect!</p>
